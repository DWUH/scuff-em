<h1> Input impedance, mutual coupling, and radiated fields of microstrip RF devices</h1>

In this example, we use the
[<span class=SC>scuff-em</span> RF module][scuff-rf]
together with
[<span class=SC>scuff-em</span>'s built-in support for
implicit multilayer dielectric substrates in full-wave calculations][libSubstrate]
to compute multiport $Z$-parameters, $S$-parameters, and radiated
field pattern of antennas, coplanar waveguides, and other *microstrip RF
devices*---arbitrarily-shaped finite-sized metal traces lying on the surface of
an (infinite-area) dielectric substrate, optionally terminated below by a
perfectly-conducting ground plane. More specifically, we will consider 
three particular examples (click the pictures for larger images):

In all of these calculations, the metal traces (red regions) are described by
the usual [discretized triangle mesh files common to all <span class=SC>scuff-em</span>
geometries][scuffEMGeometries], but the dielectric substrate (green) and ground plane
(black bottom layer) are *not meshed*; instead, the presence of the substrate layers
is taken into account 
[*implicitly* through the use of an appropriate Green's function.][libSubstrate]
(Note that this implicitly-described substrate is always infinitely extended in the
$x$ and $y$ directions; do not be misled by the apparently finite transverse size of
the substrates in the pictures above.)

The input files for all of these examples may be found in the `share/scuff-em/examples/MicrostripDevices`
subdirectory of your <span class=SC>scuff-em</span> installation.

## The <span class=SC>scuff-em</span> RF module: A brief overview

The <span class=SC>scuff-em</span> RF module is discussed in detail
at [its main documentation page][scuff-rf], but for busy readers
we summarize here some salient points.

+ The module extends the [<span class=SC>scuff-em</span> core library][libscuff] to
  allow RF modeling problems to be studied within the framework of the
  [surface-integral-equation (SIE) approach to electromagnetic scattering implemented by <span class=SC>scuff-em</span>][libscuff].

+ The functionality of the module may be accessed either from C++/python
  API codes or via the `scuff-rf` command-line module distributed with
  <span class=SC>scuff-em</span>; in particular, all of the microstrip-device
  calculations covered in this example may be done equally well
  in python or from the command line, and we will show how to do everything
  both ways.

+ The primary way in which the RF module extends the core library is by adding
  support for [*RF ports*][RFPorts], regions of meshed surfaces at which external
  RF currents (white arrows in the figures above) are injected or extracted.
  This means that, in addition to specifying the usual
  [collection of meshed surfaces constituting a <span class=SC>scuff-em</span> geometry][scuffEMGeometries],
  you must also define one or more ports for your structure.
  Port terminals in <span class=SC>scuff-em</span> are defined by geometric objects:
  lines or polygons (identifying regions on the boundaries of meshed surfaces)
  or points (identifying source/sink points inside meshed surfaces).
  Port definitions may be communicated to <span class=SC>scuff-em</span> by
    + **(a)** writing a simple text file (`.ports` file),
    + **(b)** making API calls from C++/python,
    + **(c)** creating a GDSII file containing points, lines, or polygons tagged by special text strings.

  Examples of all of these methods are discussed below.

## Layout of the `MicrostripDevices` directory

All files needed to run the examples described here may be found
in the `share/scuff-em/examples/MicrostripDevices` directory of your
<span class=SC>scuff-em</span> installation. The files are organized into
subdirectories as follows:

+ `scuffgeoFiles`: <span class=SC>scuff-em</span> geometry files (`.scuffgeo` files)
+ `mshFiles`: [<span class=SC>gmsh</span>][GMSH]-produced mesh files (`.msh` files) referenced by the `.scuffgeo files
+ `geoFiles`: [<span class=SC>gmsh</span>][GMSH] geometry files (`.geo` files) that are meshed by [[gmsh]] to produce `.msh` files
+ `portFiles`: Files defining [RF ports][RFPorts] (`.port` files)
+ `GDSIIFiles`: GDSII files that may be used in place of `.port` files (and optionally in place of `.scuffgeo` files, although this is [not recommended](../../applications/scuff-rf/scuff-rf.md#GDSIIGeometrySpecification))
+ `python`: Python scripts that run the calculations described below
+ `bashScripts`: Shell scripts that run the calculations described below

## Example 1: Edge-fed patch antenna

Our first example is the *edge-fed patch antenna* shown above and studied originally in this paper:

+ [Wu et al., "Feeding Structure Contribution to Radiation by Patch Antennas with Rectangular Boundaries," IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation **40** 1245 (1992). DOI: 10.1109/8.18245][PatchAntennaPaper]

This antenna is also used as a demonstration example for the commercial solver FEKO:

+ [http://feko.info/fekoweb/applications/white-papers/edge_fed_rectangular_microstrip_patch_antenna/document](http://feko.info/fekoweb/applications/white-papers/edge_fed_rectangular_microstrip_patch_antenna/document)

### Defining metal meshes

The metal patch is described by the [GMSH][GMSH] geometry file 
[`EdgeFedAntenna.geo`](EdgeFedAntenna.geo),
which we process with [[gmsh]] to yield mesh files
`EFAntenna_L8_Coarse.msh` (coarser discretization) and
`EFAntenna_L8_Fine.msh` (finer discretization):

```bash
 % gmsh -2 EdgeFedAntenna.geo -setnumber LFeed 8.0 -setnumber N 1 -o EFAntenna_L8_Coarse.geo
 % gmsh -2 EdgeFedAntenna.geo -setnumber LFeed 8.0 -setnumber N 2 -o EFAntenna_L8_Fine.geo
```

The coarser mesh looks like this:

![EFAntennaMesh.png](EFAntennaMesh.png)

Note that the `.geo` file contains several user-definable parameters, of which
we are here specifying two: `LFeed` (length of feed line) and `N` (discretization
fineness, i.e. number of triangle edges per unit length). Also note that we have
taken care to create a [highly structured][HighlyStructuredMeshes] mesh,
which yields an enormous reduction in computational cost.

### Defining ports

The next step is to define a single RF port with positive terminal lying on the feed edge.
(We won't specify a negative terminal for this port; this is equivalent to placing
the negative terminal on the substrate ground plane).
Note that the `.geo` file is set up to ensure that the feed edge always lies on the
$x$-axis centered at the origin, irrespective of the settings of the user-tweakable
parameters; this means that we only need to define one port specification one 
time, and can then reuse it for all meshes produced from this `.geo` file.
In this case, we can simply specify the port to be defined by a line segment
lying on the $x$ axis and extending at least over the
range $\left[-\frac{W_{\hbox{feed}}}{2}, +\frac{W_{\hbox{feed}}}{2}\right]$.
For example, we might define this line segment to run from 
$\vb x_1=(-5;0,0)$ to $\vb x_2=(+5,0,0)$; in a python code
this would look like

```python
  Solver.AddPort([-5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0])
```

Alternatively, we could write a `.port` file (call it `EFAntenna.ports`)
consisting of just three lines:

```python
PORT
	POSITIVE -5 0 0 +5 0 0 
ENDPORT
```

and specify this file by saying `Solver.SetPortFile("EFAntenna.ports")` (in python)
or `--portFile EFAntenna.ports` on the <span class=SC>scuff-rf</span> command line.

### Defining the substrate

Finally, we need to define the grounded dielectric substrate. Referring to the
[original paper][PatchAntennaPaper] cited above, the substrate has relative
permittivity $\epsilon_r=2.2$ and thickness $h=0.794$ mm and is terminated by a 
ground plane. We could describe this situation in python by saying

```python
   Solver.SetSubstratePermittivity(2.2)
   Solver.SetSubstrateThickness(0.794)
```

Alternatively, we could write a text file called `EFAntenna.substrate`:

```python
0.0    CONST_EPS_2.2
-0.794 GROUNDPLANE 
```

and say `Solver.SetSubstrateFile("EFAntenna.substrate")` (in python) or 
`--substratefile EFAntenna.substrate` (on the <span class=SC>scuff-rf</span>
command line). (Or we could include the content of the file
in a `SUBSTRATE...ENDSUBSTRATE` clause in a `.scuffgeo` file.)

### Python calculation

### Command-line calculation

Here's how the same calculation is run from the command line using `scuff-rf`:

## Example 2: Coupled center-fed patch antennas

For our next trick, we again pursue the theme of microstrip patch antennas, but now
with some variations:

+ First, instead of the reflection coefficient ($S_{11}$)
  of a single antenna, we'll look at the *coupling* ($S_{12}$) between
  *two* patch antennas.

+ Second, these antennas are driven by currents injected into points lying 
  inside them (they are *center-fed*), not edge-fed like the previous example.

+ Third, instead of varying the frequency, we'll (mostly) 
  keep the frequency fixed and instead vary the *separation distance* between the
  patches; to do this with maximum efficiency in <span class=SC>scuff-em</span> we
  will need to take advantage of the [structure of the system matrix][Implementation]---which
  will turn out to be extremely easy to do. 

The antennas in this example were studied in this paper:
